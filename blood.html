   <b> Blood bank with 1000 unit capacity and facilities for screening of blood for Hepatitis B & C, VDRL, Malarial Parasites, & HIV/AIDS
    With our real – time PCR we can detect the viral load in case of a viral disease with quantification of the infectious agent as well as genotyping which cannot be done by the ordinary PCR method.</b></p>
    

<h1 style="color:rgb(8, 14, 66);font-size:190%;">|Biochemistry</h1>
<p style="font-size: 140%;">The Biochemistry Laboratory has a comprehensive test menu of analytes and thus serving the needs of various clinical specialities. It is a NABL accredited laboratory that has the highest quality standards in patient care. The Biochemistry Laboratory also has a state of art facility which includes high throughput (fast) clinical chemistry autoanalysers, semi automated analysers, Electro Chemiluminescence based Immunoassay analyzer, Electrolyte analysers etc. The laboratory has bidirectionally interfaced equipments providing connectivity with the hospital management system and thus ensuring accurate and quick results. The laboratory participates in External Quality Assurance programmes. Research work is also done in the laboratory on biomarkers in various diseases.</p>
<h1 style="color:rgb(8, 14, 66);font-size:190%;">|Molecular Testing</h1>
<p style="font-size :140%;">This highly advanced department is equipped with rapid molecular detection facilities like CBNAAT (GeneXpert), which detects many deadly infections like COVID 19, Tuberculosis, Influenza (including H1N1), RSV, HBV DNA, HCV RNA, Clostridium difficile toxin within an hour or two. The unit is equipped with syndrome-based Multiplex PCR system (Biofire) that detects pathogens causing upper respiratory infections, pneumonia, meningitis and gastro-enteritis, within a matter of a few hours. There is also a full-fledged RTPCR Lab on the second floor with two Real Time PCR analyzers (Rotor Gene Q and CFX96), automated nucleic acid extractor (Kingfisher), manual extraction facilities, biosafety and laminar airflow cabinets, deep freezers and high speed cold centrifuge. The lab got ICMR approval for COVID 19 (SARS-CoV2) testing as early as on April 6, 2020, and is reputed for delivering authentic COVID reports with a turn-around time of only 6-8 hours. The lab. is also one of the few private labs. approved by the West Bengal Health Department for Flu-PCR testing. The lab also has facilities for genome sequencing by Sanger’s sequencing method.</p>
<h1 style="color:rgb(8, 14, 66);font-size:190%;">|Infectious Disease Serology & Immunology</h1>
<p style="font-size :140%;">Infectious Disease Serology & Immunology section is equipped with modern equipment like Vitros Immunoassay system, Mini-Vidas, automated ELISA reader and Immunofluorescence microscope. There are facilities for immunofluorescence studies for ANA, dsDNA, pANCA , cANCA; ANA, Hepatitis & Gastric profiles by Immunoblot technology; all Hepatitis markers; TORCH; Dengue etc. besides rare parameters like Galactomannan (Aspergillus) antigen, Scrub typhus IgM and Brucella Serology.</p>
